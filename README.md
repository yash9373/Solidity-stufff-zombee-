# zomie.sol
    The contract named ZombieFactory is defined.
    The NewZombie event is declared, which will be emitted when a new zombie is created. It includes parameters zombieId, name, and dna to capture information about the new zombie.
    Constants dnaDigits and dnaModulus are defined to control DNA calculations.
    A Zombie struct is defined to represent a zombie, consisting of properties name and dna.
    An array zombies is used to store instances of the Zombie struct.
    Two mappings, zombieToOwner and ownerZombieCount, are used to associate zombie IDs with owners' addresses and keep track of how many zombies each owner owns.
    The _createZombie function is defined as private. It creates a new zombie with the given name and DNA, updating the mappings and emitting the NewZombie event.
    The _generateRandomDna function calculates a pseudo-random DNA based on the provided string.
    The createRandomZombie function allows users to create a new random zombie with a given name. It checks if the sender already owns any zombies and generates a random DNA to create the new zombie.

This code defines a basic zombie creation contract where users can create random zombies with unique DNA and names. The contract includes events for tracking new zombie creations and uses mappings to associate zombies with their owners. It demonstrates the usage of mappings, structs, events, and private functions in Solidity.
